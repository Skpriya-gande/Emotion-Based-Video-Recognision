# Video-Based Emotion Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from video data using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Facial expressions are detected from video frames using **OpenCV**, and emotions are classified using a deep learning model.

## 📌 Project Overview
The system processes video input (real-time or recorded), extracts frames, detects faces using OpenCV, and analyzes facial expressions to identify emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted, and neutral**.

By leveraging video data instead of single images, the model captures temporal information, resulting in more accurate emotion recognition.

## 🧠 Workflow
1. Capture video input (live webcam or video file)
2. Convert video into frames
3. Detect faces in each frame using **OpenCV**
4. Preprocess facial regions
5. Classify emotions using a deep learning model
6. Display predicted emotion on the video output

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
